        <h1>Privacy Policy for VRemindApp/Android</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 30, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>VX Software Solutions</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") processes information on behalf of educational institutions ("Schools") that use our <strong>VRemindApp/Android</strong> platform (the "Service"). This Service is designed to help Schools manage academic-related data, create student profiles, and onboard students for educational purposes.</p>

        <h2>Our Role: Data Processor</h2>
        <p>We act primarily as a <strong>Data Processor</strong> (or Service Provider) for the Schools that use our Service. This means we process personal data <em>on behalf of</em> and strictly according to the instructions of the Schools. The School is the <strong>Data Controller</strong> (or Business) and is responsible for defining how and why student and other user data is collected and used. Our obligations to protect student data are defined in our agreements with the Schools.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect and process various types of information, which are primarily provided by the Schools or generated through the use of the Service by School personnel and students:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information Provided by Schools:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>School Administrative Data:</strong> School name, address, contact information, subscription details.</li>
                    <li><strong>School User Accounts:</strong> Names, email addresses, roles (e.g., administrator, teacher) for School personnel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Student Data (provided by the School):</strong> Student names, unique student IDs, enrollment information, academic records (e.g., grades, attendance, assignments, performance metrics), demographic information (if provided by the School for educational purposes), parent/guardian contact information.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Information Generated Through Use of the Service:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how Schools and their authorized users interact with the Service, such as features used, time spent, login/logout timestamps, and activity logs. This helps us monitor performance and improve the Service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> IP addresses, browser type, operating system, device identifiers, and other technical information necessary for the Service to function and for security purposes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect solely for the purpose of providing and maintaining the Service to the Schools, as instructed by them, and to improve our Service. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> Enabling Schools to create, manage, and access student and academic data; facilitating communication and administrative tasks within the School environment.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve Our Service:</strong> Analyzing usage patterns to understand how the Service is used and to identify areas for improvement, new features, and technical optimization. This is done in an aggregated and anonymized manner where possible, not tied to individual students.</li>
            <li><strong>For Security and Compliance:</strong> Protecting the integrity and security of the Service, detecting and preventing fraud, and complying with legal obligations.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Responding to inquiries and providing technical support to Schools and their authorized users.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>3. How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>We share information only under the following circumstances, strictly in accordance with our agreements with Schools and applicable laws:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With the School and its Authorized Users:</strong> Student and academic data are accessible to the respective School (as the Data Controller) and its authorized personnel (e.g., administrators, teachers) and the student's parents/guardians, as permitted by the School's policies and legal requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>With Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We may engage third-party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, database management, analytics, maintenance). These third parties are bound by strict contractual obligations to protect the data and are only permitted to use it as necessary to provide the services to us. They are prohibited from using the data for their own purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law, court order, or governmental regulation, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights or property, (c) prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service, or (d) protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your personal data may be transferred. We will provide notice before personal data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement robust technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the data we process from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include encryption, access controls, regular security audits, and adherence to industry best practices. While we strive to protect your personal data, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain personal data processed on behalf of Schools for as long as necessary to provide the Service, fulfill our contractual obligations with the Schools, and comply with legal requirements. Schools typically control the retention periods for their data. Upon termination of our agreement with a School, we will delete or return the School's data in accordance with the agreement and applicable law.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>6. Your Data Rights (as a Data Subject)</h2>
        <p>Since we act as a Data Processor, individuals (including students and their parents/guardians) who wish to exercise their data rights (e.g., access, correction, deletion, restriction of processing) regarding data processed by the Service should direct their requests to the relevant <strong>School (the Data Controller)</strong>. The School is responsible for responding to such requests in accordance with their own privacy policies and applicable laws. We will assist Schools in fulfilling these requests as required by our agreements.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy (COPPA & Similar Regulations)</h2>
        <p>Our Service is designed for use by Schools and is not intended for direct use by children under the age of [e.g., 13, or relevant age in your jurisdiction] without the consent and supervision of the School and/or parents/guardians.</p>
        <p>We process student personal data solely on behalf of Schools. The School is responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent for students to use the Service and for the collection of their personal information, in compliance with applicable laws such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and similar children's privacy laws globally.</p>
        <p>If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of [e.g., 13] without verifiable parental consent obtained by the School, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers. If you believe we may have inadvertently collected personal information from a child without proper consent, please contact us immediately.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
