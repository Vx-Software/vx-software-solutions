# Privacy Policy for VRemindApp/Android

**Last Updated:** May 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **VX Software Solutions** ("we," "us," or "our") processes information on behalf of educational institutions ("Schools") that use our **VRemindApp/Android** platform (the "Service"). This Service is designed to help Schools manage academic-related data, create student profiles, and onboard students for educational purposes.

**Our Role: Data Processor**
We act primarily as a **Data Processor** (or Service Provider) for the Schools that use our Service. This means we process personal data *on behalf of* and strictly according to the instructions of the Schools. The School is the **Data Controller** (or Business) and is responsible for defining how and why student and other user data is collected and used. Our obligations to protect student data are defined in our agreements with the Schools.

* **With Third-Party Service Providers:** We may engage third-party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, database management, analytics, maintenance). These third parties are bound by strict contractual obligations to protect the data and are only permitted to use it as necessary to provide the services to us. They are prohibited from using the data for their own purposes.

## 4. Data Security

We implement robust technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the data we process from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include encryption, access controls, regular security audits, and adherence to industry best practices. While we strive to protect your personal data, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 5. Data Retention

We retain personal data processed on behalf of Schools for as long as necessary to provide the Service, fulfill our contractual obligations with the Schools, and comply with legal requirements. Schools typically control the retention periods for their data. Upon termination of our agreement with a School, we will delete or return the School's data in accordance with the agreement and applicable law.

## 6. Your Data Rights (as a Data Subject)

Since we act as a Data Processor, individuals (including students and their parents/guardians) who wish to exercise their data rights (e.g., access, correction, deletion, restriction of processing) regarding data processed by the Service should direct their requests to the relevant **School (the Data Controller)**. The School is responsible for responding to such requests in accordance with their own privacy policies and applicable laws. We will assist Schools in fulfilling these requests as required by our agreements.

If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of [e.g., 13] without verifiable parental consent obtained by the School, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.
